# Getting started

## 1) Access and sign in

- Open the dashboard and **Sign in**.
- If you don’t have an account, create one in **Register** (email confirmation may be required depending on Supabase settings).

## 2) Verify everything works

1. Go to **Overview** and check KPIs.
2. Go to **Players** and try a simple filter (e.g., position or country).
3. Go to **Leagues** and switch between **Rank** and **Metrics** modes.


## 3) Recommended workflow

1. **Players**: filter and save a search (shortlist).
2. **Scouting Search** (Pro/Business): prioritize by Scouting Index + Upside.
3. **Compare**: compare two finalists 1v1.
4. **Player Inspector** (Business): when you need extended details.

## 4) Language toggle (ES/EN)

Use the `ES` / `EN` button in the top bar to switch.
