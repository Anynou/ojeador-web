# Compare (Pro/Business)

1v1 comparison using two `player_id` values.

## How to use

Get `player_id` from:

   - Players table (Free) or Scouting Search
   - CSV export

Paste one id into A and the other into B.

Run comparison.

## What it shows

- Basic info for both players
- Scouting Index / Upside
- `pillars` blocks (performance, form, progression, reliability, trend)
- profile tags (`profile_tags`)

!!! note "If only one player is returned"
    Usually means one ID is invalid or not available for your plan.
